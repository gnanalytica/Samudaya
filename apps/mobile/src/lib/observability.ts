/**
 * Crash reporting for the phone app, and the limits on what it may carry.
 *
 * Off unless EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN is set, so a build without one — CI's
 * bundle check, a local run, a fork — behaves exactly as it did before this
 * existed.
 *
 * The privacy rules are the same as the web app's, and they are a decision
 * rather than a default. Residents' names, flats, phone numbers and payment
 * references are what the whole RLS layer exists to protect; posting them to a
 * third party to symbolicate a stack trace would undo that quietly. It is also
 * what the Play Data Safety form and the App Store privacy labels have to
 * declare, and "crash logs contain no personal data" is only sayable if it is
 * actually true.
 *
 * So no PII, no session replay, no traces — and a scrubber for the places a
 * name can still hide.
