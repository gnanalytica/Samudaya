/**
 * The demo video may not claim a capability the product does not have.
 *
 * A recording of the app cannot lie. A drawing can say anything, and the
 * video has a lot of drawing in it now — the MCP scene, because an MCP server
 * has no pixels to film, and the whole portrait cut. The first draft of the
 * MCP scene invented four scope names that read perfectly and matched
 * nothing.
 *
 * So every tool name and scope it shows is checked against the source it came
 * from, and the drawn screens are checked against the demo data the filmed
 * cuts use. A tool renamed in `mcp-tools.ts`, or a figure that drifts between
 * two screens, fails here rather than shipping as a promise the product does
 * not keep.
