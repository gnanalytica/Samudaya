 * feature cards do not answer the question they actually have — what this
 * looks like when their neighbours use it. So the explainer runs on the
 * landing page before anybody signs in.
 *
 * What is pinned here is what would break it quietly. A hero that autoplays
 * for somebody who asked their system for less motion is a bug nobody reports.
 * A file that streams faster than a phone on mobile data can fetch it is a
 * landing page that stalls, and the number only moves when someone re-encodes
 * it, which is exactly when a test should object.
