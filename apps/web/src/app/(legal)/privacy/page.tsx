            {LEGAL.product} helps residential communities plan events together — the people,
            activities, checklists, funds and a public ledger of what was spent. Doing that means
            handling some personal data about you and your neighbours. This policy explains what we
            collect, why, who can see it, and the choices you have.

            It applies to the {LEGAL.product} website, the Android and iOS apps, the WhatsApp bot
            and the {LEGAL.product} API. It is written with India’s Digital Personal Data Protection
            Act, 2023 (the <Strong>DPDP Act</Strong>) in mind. Using {LEGAL.product} is also subject

          {LEGAL.product} is operated by <Strong>{LEGAL.operator}</Strong> (“we”, “us”). For the
          personal data needed to run your account and the service, we are the Data Fiduciary under

        <p>
          Each community on {LEGAL.product} is run by its own admins — usually the society’s
          committee. They decide which events, funds, notices and records their community keeps, and
          who may join. We store and process that community information so the service can work for
          them.

          profile photo — we do not ask for access to your Gmail, contacts, calendar or files. With
          an email link, we receive your email address.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Strong>Your profile.</Strong> Your name, email address, phone number (if you add one),
          profile photo and preferred language.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Strong>Your community membership.</Strong> The communities you ask to join or belong to,
          your role (for example resident or admin), the flat or unit you live in and who else is
          recorded as living there, your join requests and their approval, and invite codes you
          create, redeem or try.

        <p>
          <Strong>What you do in your community.</Strong> Announcements you post or read, votes you
          cast in polls, event tasks assigned to you, activities you sign up to perform in,
          volunteer roles you take on, and activity ideas you suggest or show interest in. When you
          sign up for an activity, organisers may ask for details such as the type of performance,
          age group, experience and any special requirements — share only what they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Strong>Money records.</Strong> Contributions to an event fund — the amount, the payment
          method you used (such as UPI), a payment reference and a receipt number — and expenses
          filed by admins, with the vendor, amount, who requested and approved it, and a reference
          to the bill. {LEGAL.product} <Strong>records</Strong> payments; it does not currently
          process card, UPI or bank payments itself, and we never receive your card number, UPI PIN
          or bank login.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Strong>WhatsApp.</Strong> If you use the {LEGAL.product} WhatsApp bot, we store your
          WhatsApp phone number, the link between that number and your account, and the messages you
          send to and receive from the bot, including their delivery status.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Strong>Mobile app.</Strong> If you allow notifications, we store a push-notification
          token for your device, the platform (Android or iOS) and the app version, and the in-app
          notifications we create for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Strong>Activity records.</Strong> An audit trail of significant actions — for example who
          approved an expense or changed a fund — with the time and whether it came from the web,
          mobile, WhatsApp or the API. Our hosting and database providers also keep routine
          technical logs, such as IP addresses and request times, to operate and secure the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Strong>Crash reports.</Strong> When the app or the website hits an error, we send a
          report so we can fix it: what went wrong, where in our code, the app version and the kind
          of device. These reports are deliberately built to carry <Strong>no personal data</Strong>{' '}
          — we switch off the parts of our error-reporting tool that would attach your identity,
          your IP address or what you had typed, and we remove anything sensitive from the address
          of the page you were on. We do not record your screen and we do not trace what you do in
          the app.

          We process this data on the basis of your consent, which you give by signing up and
          choosing to use these features, and for legitimate uses the DPDP Act allows, such as
          complying with law. We do not sell personal data, show advertising, or use your data to

          {LEGAL.product} is built so that a community can be transparent about money without
          exposing individuals more than necessary. Access rules are enforced in the database
          itself, not just in the app.

        <LegalList>
          <li>

        <p>
          Some of these providers may process data outside India. Where they do, we rely on their
          contractual and security commitments and follow any restrictions the Government of India
          places on transfers. We may also disclose data when required by law, to protect the rights
          and safety of our users or the public, or as part of a merger or transfer of the service,
          in which case this policy continues to apply.

      <LegalSection id="ai-assistants" title="API keys and AI assistants">
        <p>
          A community’s admins can create API keys that let other software — including an AI
          assistant connected through our MCP server — read or act on that community’s data. Each
          key is limited to the permissions the admin grants, acts as a named member of the
          community, and every action it takes is recorded in the audit trail.
        </p>
        <p>
          {LEGAL.product} does not itself send your data to AI providers. If an admin connects an AI
          assistant, the data it retrieves is handled by that assistant’s provider under its own
          terms, and the admin is responsible for that choice. Admins can revoke a key at any time.

          <li>
            your profile, community memberships, flat assignments, join requests, votes, sign-ups,

            contributions, expenses and audit entries you were part of are{' '}
            <Strong>kept but no longer linked to your account</Strong>, because a community’s ledger
            has to keep adding up. A contribution can remain associated with the flat it was made
            for;

          <li>
            messages exchanged with the WhatsApp bot are kept as operational records with your phone

        <p>
          If your community is removed from {LEGAL.product}, its records are deleted with it.

          Data travels over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS). Access to every table is controlled
          by row-level security rules in the database, so a member can only read what their role

          access to production systems is limited.
