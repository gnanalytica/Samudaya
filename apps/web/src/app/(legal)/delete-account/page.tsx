            You can delete your {LEGAL.product} account at any time, and you do not need to ask

          <p>
            This page explains how, and exactly what goes. What it describes is the same in the app,
            on the phone and by email — there is one deletion, not three. Our{' '}

          Both ask you to type the word DELETE first. That is the only confirmation: once it goes
          through, your account is gone and you are signed out.

          If you have already uninstalled the app, lost access to the email address you signed in
          with, or would simply rather we did it, write to <ContactLink /> from the address on your
          account, or tell us which one it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may need to confirm your identity before we delete anything, because doing this on the
          say-so of whoever sent the email would be its own privacy problem. We aim to acknowledge
          the request promptly and complete it within the time India&rsquo;s Digital Personal Data
          Protection Act, 2023 and its rules require.

          If you were the only member of a society, that society is deleted with you, along with its
          events, tasks and records. A society with no members cannot be opened by anybody again, so
          leaving it behind would only keep data nobody can ever reach.

          This is the one place we keep something after you ask us to delete your account, and it is
          the point of the product: a society&rsquo;s ledger is a shared record that its members
          rely on, and a total that changes when somebody leaves is not a record. What is kept is
          the money, not you — the rows no longer name you or link to your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Messages you exchanged with the {LEGAL.product} WhatsApp bot are kept as operational
          records with your phone number but without the link to your account. We will delete those
          too on request.

      <LegalSection id="committee" title="If you run a society">
        <p>
          There is one case where the app will refuse, and it tells you which society: you are the
          last committee member of a society that still has other members. Nobody would be left who
          could approve a bill, admit a resident or close an event — and because appointing a
          committee member is itself a committee decision, nobody left could fix it either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make somebody else a committee member first, from <Strong>People</Strong>, and then delete
          your account. If the society has no other members, this does not apply and you can delete
          straight away.
