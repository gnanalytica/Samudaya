/**
 * Everything the society has been asked for, in one place.
 *
 * Fundraising was the only thing a resident could start from Home, which left
 * everything that costs nothing — a weekly badminton hour, a rule about the
 * terrace, a thank-you for the security staff — with nowhere to go. This was
 * that page, and for a while it was only that: suggestions about an event
 * stayed on the event, so somebody wondering whether a thing had already been
 * suggested had to know which kind it was to know where to look. Both kinds
 * are here now, each saying which event it belongs to, and an event's page
 * still shows its own.
