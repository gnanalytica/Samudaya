 * for them here would turn "start your society" into a form nobody finishes on
 * a phone. The address is offered because it is the one checklist step whose
 * answer the founder already has in their head.
 *
 * The phone is not optional. The founder is the committee, and until this was
 * asked for they were the one member of a society nobody could reach — the
 * join form has always asked every resident for theirs.
