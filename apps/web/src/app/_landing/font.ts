 * The front page's display face: Baloo 2, round and warm, for headlines and the

 * Devanagari as well as Latin, so "समुदाय" is drawn in the same hand as
 * "Samudaya" rather than falling back to whatever the phone has.
 *
 * Self-hosted by next/font at build time, so a visitor's browser never asks
 * Google for it. Exposed as --font-baloo, which `font-display` reads
 * (globals.css), on the landing page's root element only.
