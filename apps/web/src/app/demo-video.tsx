 * Under two minutes of the app, on the front page.

 * Animated rather than filmed since `video/src/story.tsx` — what plays here is
 * the `Explain` cut, drawn from the app's own screens and data.
 *
 * A society's committee is being asked to put the society's money somewhere,
 * and six feature cards do not answer the question they actually have, which
 * is what this looks like when their neighbours use it. So the ledger is on
 * the page, moving, before anybody has signed in.
 *
 * It starts itself rather than carrying `autoplay`, because that attribute has
 * no way to ask whether the visitor wants motion. Somebody who has told their
 * system to reduce it gets the poster and the controls, which is the whole
 * video, just not uninvited. Browsers that block autoplay outright land in the
 * same place, so there is nothing extra to handle.

      Chaturthi, someone else confirms it, and it goes on the ledger every resident can see, with a
      name and flat. Then the money out: a bill the person who filed it can&rsquo;t approve,

      the society.
