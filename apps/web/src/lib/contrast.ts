/**
 * Just enough colour science to keep a festival's colours readable.
 *
 * The palettes in core were chosen by eye, and a few are pale in light mode:
 * Pongal's turmeric under white button text is 3.5:1 and Ganesh Chaturthi's
 * saffron is 4.1:1, against the 4.5:1 that text needs. Inside an event that
 * is one screen for one fortnight. On the front page, which wears whichever
 * festival is next, it would be the sign-up button for weeks at a time.
 *
 * So the page deepens a colour until it passes — same hue and chroma, lower
 * lightness — and leaves every colour that already passes exactly as it was.
 * Only the light-mode half changes; the dark-mode colours are all light enough
 * against the dark ink the app puts on them.
