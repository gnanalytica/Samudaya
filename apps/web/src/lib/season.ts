/**
 * What the front page is dressed as, and what it lists as coming up.
 *
 * Inside the app every event takes its festival's colours — marigold for
 * Deepavali, vermilion and indigo for Dasara — and the landing page was the
 * one screen left in the default green. So it now does the same thing the
 * product does, with the calendar the event wizard already uses: it wears the
 * colours of the next festival a society will be planning for, and names the
 * few after it.
 *
 * Two rules come from the calendar rather than from taste:
 *
 * - A date the calendar only estimates is never shown as a date. Diwali is
 *   stored as the middle of the window it usually falls in; printing
 *   "1 Nov 2026" on the front page would be exactly the false precision the
 *   calendar's own notes warn against. Those festivals show their window.
 *
 * - The page's colours skip everything that is not a festival: the national
 *   days, Children's Day, Yoga Day. They belong on the list; they are not what
 *   anybody means by making the page festive.
 *
 * Every palette handed back has been through `legible`, because this page
 * wears whichever one is next and its sign-up button is white text on it.
