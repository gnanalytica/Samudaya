/**
 * Everything the desktop sidebar has, reachable from a phone.
 *
 * The bottom bar carries four tabs — Home, Events, People, Me — and that is
 * the right number to fit. What it could not carry went nowhere: on a phone
 * there was no route at all to Manage, To do, Reconcile, Society settings, or
 * to the society switcher and the join-and-create links inside it. A committee
 * member on their phone could not approve a bill or reconcile a statement, and
 * nobody on a phone could join a second society. The sidebar was not "desktop
 * first", it was the only navigation, and half the app sat behind it.
 *
 * So the society name in the header — which was a link to Home, a place the
 * bottom bar already goes — becomes the way in. Tapping it opens the sidebar
 * as a sheet, with exactly the same children the sidebar renders, because
 * parity by construction beats parity by remembering to update two lists.
 *
 * A sheet rather than another `<details>` menu: this is tall, it wants the
 * page not to scroll underneath it, and it wants a back gesture and Escape to
 * close it. That is enough behaviour to be worth the client component.
