 * know about. Money took the other because the ledger is the thing this app
 * exists to publish, and asking a resident to open Home first to read it is
 * the same mistake one step smaller.
 *
 * What gives way both times is People. It is a directory you consult now and
 * then rather than daily, and it keeps its place in the sidebar, in the sheet,
 * as the second row of the Manage hub, and under "More in this society" on
 * Home — which is built by subtracting this bar from the list, so the two
 * cannot drift.
 *
 * Contribute is the one thing a resident most often opens the app to do, so it
 * is a button rather than a tab. Staff don't contribute and don't get it.
