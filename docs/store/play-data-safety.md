# Play Console — Data safety

Every answer below comes from [`data-collection.md`](./data-collection.md).
Transcribe, do not re-derive: the point of one inventory is that the two stores
cannot end up saying different things about the same app.

Play Console → **App content** → **Data safety**.

## Before the data types: the questions at the top

| Question                                                              | Answer                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types?   | **Yes**                                                                    |
| Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit?   | **Yes** — HTTPS/TLS throughout; Supabase, Vercel and Expo are all TLS-only |
| Do you provide a way for users to request that their data be deleted? | **Yes**                                                                    |
| Account deletion URL                                                  | `https://samudaya.gnanalytica.com/delete-account`                          |
| Does your app allow users to request account deletion in the app?     | **Yes** — Settings on the web, Me → Delete account on the phone            |
| Privacy policy URL                                                    | `https://samudaya.gnanalytica.com/privacy`                                 |
| Independent security review                                           | **No** (do not tick it; there has not been one)                            |
| Play Families Policy                                                  | **Not applicable** — the app is for adults, 18+                            |

## The data types

For every row: **Collected = Yes**, **Shared = No**, **Processed ephemerally =
No**, **Purpose = App functionality** unless a row says otherwise. Nothing here
is collected for analytics, advertising, personalisation or developer
communications, because none of those exist in this app.

"Shared" in Play's sense means passing data to a _third party_ — a processor
acting on our instructions (Supabase, Vercel, Expo) is not sharing. Google's
own definition says so; the Privacy Policy lists them anyway.

## Permissions Play will ask about

The Android manifest, after merging, declares:

| Permission                                                               | Why                                               | Source                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `INTERNET`                                                               | It is a networked app                             | Template                                |
| `VIBRATE`                                                                | Notification vibration                            | `expo-notifications`                    |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`                                                     | Android 13+ notification prompt                   | `expo-notifications`                    |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`                                                 | Rescheduling notifications after a restart        | `expo-notifications`                    |
| `CAMERA`                                                                 | Photographing a bill                              | `expo-image-picker`                     |
| `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (`maxSdkVersion="32"`) | Picking an existing photo on Android 12 and below | `expo-image-picker`, `expo-file-system` |

Two are deliberately removed, and stay removed:

- `RECORD_AUDIO` — via `microphonePermission: false`.
- `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` ("display over other apps") — the React Native
  template adds it for the developer menu. It is in
  `android.blockedPermissions` in `apps/mobile/app.json`; a release build has
  no use for it, and it is exactly the kind of permission a reviewer stops on.

Verify after any dependency change with:

```
cd apps/mobile && npx expo prebuild --platform android --no-install --clean
grep uses-permission android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
```

There is **no sensitive-permission declaration form to file**: the app requests
no `SMS`, `CALL_LOG`, `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`,
location or accessibility permission.
