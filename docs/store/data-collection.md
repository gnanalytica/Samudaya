# What Samudaya actually collects

The inventory both store forms are filled in from. It is written from the
schema in `supabase/migrations/` and the code that reads and writes it, not
from what the product would like to be true — if a row below does not match
`\d public.<table>`, the row is wrong.

**Change this file first.** The Play Data Safety form, the App Store privacy
labels, the `ios.privacyManifests` block in `apps/mobile/app.json` and the
Privacy Policy at `apps/web/src/app/(legal)/privacy/page.tsx` are all
downstream of it, and a disclosure that has quietly stopped being true is a
worse problem than one that was never filed.

## Collected, and **not** linked to you

| What                                 | Where it goes                  | Why                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Crash reports and error stack traces | Sentry, if a DSN is configured | So a resident hitting a broken screen is something we find out about |

This is the one entry that carries a deliberate technical decision rather than
a description. Both apps initialise Sentry with `sendDefaultPii: false`, no
session replay, no traces, and a `beforeSend` that deletes the `user` object,
cookies, request bodies and query strings, keeps only `content-type` and
`user-agent` headers, and rewrites `/invite/CODE` to `/invite/[code]`. See
`apps/web/src/lib/observability.ts` and `apps/mobile/src/lib/observability.ts`.

It is done that way _so that_ the answer to both stores can be "crash logs,
not linked to identity" — which is only sayable because it is true.

## Not collected at all

Checked, rather than assumed:

- **Location, of any precision.** No `expo-location`, no geolocation call.
- **Contacts.** No `expo-contacts`.
- **Microphone.** `expo-image-picker` is configured with
  `microphonePermission: false`, and the generated Android manifest carries
  `RECORD_AUDIO` with `tools:node="remove"`.
- **Advertising identifiers, and any advertising at all.** No ad SDK, no
  `AdvertisingData`.
- **Analytics or behavioural tracking.** No analytics SDK of any kind — no
  Firebase Analytics, PostHog, Mixpanel, Amplitude, or Google Tag Manager.
- **Payment instruments.** Samudaya _records_ that a UPI payment happened and
  its reference; it never touches a card number, a UPI PIN or a bank login,
  because it has no payment gateway integration of any kind.
- **Health, fitness, browsing history, search history, calendar, SMS, files
  other than the bills you attach.**

## Who else sees it

| Expo, Apple, Google      | Push tokens and the notification text                | Regional                          |
| Meta (WhatsApp Business) | Your WhatsApp number and bot messages, if you use it | Regional                          |
| Google                   | Name, email, photo — only if you sign in with Google | Regional                          |
| Sentry                   | Crash reports, scrubbed as above                     | Only when a DSN is configured     |

Nothing is sold, and nothing is shared for advertising.

## Deletion

`public.delete_my_account()` (migration `20260920001100`) deletes the account
and everything personal attached to it, keeps ledger rows with the link to you
removed, and refuses only while you are the last committee member of a society
that still has other members. The in-app path is Settings on the web and Me on
the phone; the web page Play requires is `/delete-account`.
