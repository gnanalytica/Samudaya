/**
 * Makes the copy of the video that the landing page serves.
 *
 * The render is 1920×1080 at CRF 18, which is right for anything anybody
 * downloads and wrong for a hero that autoplays. This is the same cut at 720p,
 * encoded to a fixed bitrate rather than to a quality target.
 *
 * The bitrate is the point, and it used to be a total size. The page streams
 * this file as it plays — faststart puts the index up front, and preload is
 * "metadata" — so what decides whether a phone on mobile data can keep up is
 * how many bytes arrive per second of playback, not how many there are in all.
 * A two-megabyte cap stood in for that while the cut was twenty-five seconds.
 * Once every shot was paced to be readable, `Explain` ran past two minutes, and
 * two megabytes over two minutes is about thirty kilobits a second of video:
 * the captions the pacing exists for would have smeared into illegibility.
 *
 * So the rate is fixed and the size follows the length.
 * `apps/web/test/landing-demo.test.ts` caps the rate, and caps the size too,
 * loosely, so a cut that doubled again would still be a decision.
 *
 * The poster matters as much as the video. Without one the hero is a black
 * rectangle until enough has buffered to paint, which on a phone on mobile
 * data is most of the time somebody spends on the page.
 *
 *   npm run landing
