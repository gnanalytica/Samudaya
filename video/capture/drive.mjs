/**
 * How a recording is driven: the pointer you can see, and the moves it makes.
 *
 * Two recorders share this — one at a desktop window, one at a phone. They film
 * the same product through very different layouts, and the only thing that
 * differs is what a pointer means. A desktop gets an arrow that glides between
 * things; a phone gets the ripple a finger leaves, because a phone has no
 * cursor and drawing one would be a small lie about how the app is used.
 *
 * Playwright draws neither. Its mouse is synthetic, so there is nothing for the
 * compositor to capture, which is why every screen recording made this way
 * looks haunted — menus open with nothing touching them.
 */

/**
 * Runs before anything on the page, on every navigation. It listens in the
 * capture phase so a page that stops propagation on its own handlers cannot
 * freeze the pointer, and it never touches layout: everything is fixed,
 * pointer-events:none, and appended to <html> rather than <body>, so the app
 * underneath behaves exactly as it does without it.
